# AWS Serverless Examples with Terraform

Welcome to my collection of AWS serverless examples using Terraform! In this repository, you'll find a variety of serverless applications and utilities built on AWS using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of practical examples and templates for building serverless applications on AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Whether you're new to serverless architecture or looking for advanced examples, you'll find something useful here.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use these examples, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

1. **AWS CLI**: Install the [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your local machine. You can follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) provided by AWS.

2. **Terraform**: Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) on your local machine. You can download Terraform from its official website and follow the installation instructions.

3. **AWS Account**: You'll need an AWS account to deploy the resources. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for an AWS account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/). Additionally, ensure that your AWS account has the necessary permissions to create and manage resources specified in the Terraform configurations.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the example directory you're interested in.
3. Follow the README instructions within that directory to deploy the example using Terraform. Make sure to read and follow the instructions provided in the README file of each example folder to proceed.

:warning: **AWS Cost Warning**: Please be aware that deploying resources on AWS may incur costs. Make sure to review the pricing details of the AWS services used in each example. Additionally, remember to destroy the resources using Terraform after completing your tests to avoid unexpected charges.
